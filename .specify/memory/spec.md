# Feature Specification: POS Architecture Complexity Benchmark

**Feature Branch**: `000-pos-architecture-benchmark`
**Created**: 2026-03-25
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Compare development complexity between monolith and hybrid architecture using POS vertical slice implementation"


## Clarifications

### Session 2026-03-25
- Q: What happens when stock becomes negative? → A: Allow with warning/audit log
- Q: How to handle concurrent transactions? → A: Last write wins, warn loser
- Q: Commitment granularity for SCS? → A: Atomic (logical changes)
- Q: How to handle Kafka delays? → A: Eventual Consistency
- Q: How to recover from event failure? → A: Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)


## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*


### User Story 1 - Implement Product Domain (Priority: P1)

Developer implements product management (CRUD item) in both architectures.

This includes:

* create product
* update product
* list product

**Why this priority**:
Product domain adalah fondasi semua domain lain (inventory & sales depend on it). Tanpa ini, sistem tidak punya value.

**Independent Test**:
Can be fully tested by:

* creating product
* updating product
* retrieving product list

Value delivered:

* usable minimal POS core

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** no products exist, **When** developer creates a product, **Then** product is stored and retrievable
2. **Given** existing product, **When** developer updates product, **Then** changes are persisted
3. **Given** multiple products, **When** listing products, **Then** all products are returned


### User Story 2 - Implement Inventory Domain (Priority: P2)

Developer implements stock management linked to product.

Includes:

* stock initialization
* stock update (increase/decrease)
* stock query

**Why this priority**:
Inventory depends on product but not sales → logical second layer.

**Independent Test**:
Can be tested by:

* assigning stock to product
* modifying stock
* querying stock

Value:

* system becomes operational for stock tracking

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** product exists, **When** stock is assigned, **Then** stock is recorded
2. **Given** stock exists, **When** stock is reduced, **Then** quantity is updated correctly


### User Story 3 - Implement Sales Domain (Priority: P3)

Developer implements transaction system.

Includes:

* create transaction
* reduce stock
* record sales

**Why this priority**:
Sales is the highest complexity domain and depends on both product and inventory.

**Independent Test**:
Can be tested by:

* performing a transaction
* verifying stock reduction
* verifying transaction record

Value:

* complete POS flow

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** product with stock exists, **When** transaction occurs, **Then** stock decreases
2. **Given** transaction executed, **When** queried, **Then** transaction is recorded


### User Story 4 - Implement Hybrid Architecture Infrastructure (Priority: P1)

Developer sets up hybrid architecture environment.

Includes:

* microservices separation
* Kafka communication
* CQRS setup

**Why this priority**:
Without infrastructure, hybrid architecture cannot be evaluated.

**Independent Test**:
Can be tested by:

* sending event between services
* verifying message delivery

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** service emits event, **When** Kafka processes it, **Then** other service receives it
2. **Given** command is executed, **When** CQRS handler runs, **Then** state is updated


### User Story 5 - Measure Development Complexity (Priority: P1)

System records development metrics for each SCS.

**Why this priority**:
Core purpose of experiment is measurement, not just implementation.

**Independent Test**:
Can be tested by:

* creating a branch
* making commits
* verifying metrics output

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a branch is created, **When** commits are made, **Then** metrics are recorded
2. **Given** SCS completed, **When** measurement script runs, **Then** metrics are generated


## Edge Cases

* **Negative Stock**: Allow transactions to proceed but generate a system warning and audit log.
* **Concurrent Transactions**: Last write wins; send a warning/audit log for the losing transaction.
* **Kafka Delay**: Rely on eventual consistency; services must handle late events without blocking.
* **Event Failure**: Recover via Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) for manual or automated reprocessing.
* What happens when one microservice is down?


## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

* **FR-001**: System MUST implement POS functionality in two architectures (monolith and hybrid)
* **FR-002**: System MUST maintain identical business logic across architectures
* **FR-003**: System MUST decompose system into Product, Inventory, and Sales domains
* **FR-004**: System MUST use NestJS, TypeORM, Zod, and MySQL in both architectures
* **FR-005**: Hybrid architecture MUST use Kafka for communication
* **FR-006**: Hybrid architecture MUST implement CQRS and event sourcing
* **FR-007**: System MUST track development metrics per SCS
* **FR-008**: Each branch MUST represent exactly one SCS
* **FR-009**: System MUST NOT allow cross-domain logic leakage
* **FR-010**: System MUST log all development activity relevant to metrics


### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

* **Product**: item entity with attributes like id, name, price
* **Inventory**: stock entity linked to product with quantity
* **SalesTransaction**: transaction record with items and quantities
* **Event (Hybrid)**: domain event used for inter-service communication
* **SCSMetric**: measurement data per branch (files changed, LOC, commits, time)


## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

* **SC-001**: Each SCS produces measurable metrics (files changed, LOC, commits, time)
* **SC-002**: Monolith and hybrid implementations complete same domain features
* **SC-003**: Hybrid architecture successfully processes inter-service communication via Kafka
* **SC-004**: Lead time per SCS is recorded and comparable across architectures
* **SC-005**: No SCS contains mixed concerns (validated via review)
* **SC-006**: Metrics are reproducible from git history; requires atomic commits (one commit per logical change) per SCS.


## Assumptions

* Developer follows strict SCS discipline
* Same developer implements both architectures (introduces potential bias)
* Infrastructure (Kafka, DB) is stable during experiment
* No external load testing is required (focus is development complexity, not runtime performance)
* Monolith and hybrid share equivalent domain logic
